Open Industrial Linux, is Linux distribution for Industrial Automation.
It is a simple, high efficient and easy-to-use distribution to generate
industrial embedded Linux systems via cross-compilation.

OpenIL provides industrial-grade security, trusted computing, deterministic  
networking technology and real-time Linux system.

To build and use the OpenIL, do the following:

1) run 'make menuconfig'
2) select the target architecture and the packages you wish to compile
3) run 'make'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images

You do not need to be root to build or run OpenIL.

OpenIL comes with a basic configuration for a number of boards. Run
'make list-defconfigs' to view the list of provided configurations.

You can run the images built from OpenIL quickly on some platforms, for
example ls1021atsn from NXP:

1) run 'make nxp_ls1021atsn_defconfig'
2) the nxp_ls1021atsn_defconfig has included all necessary packages
3) run 'make'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the complete image 'sdcard.img' in output/images

OpenIL supported NXP platforms:
	- LS1012ARDB
	- LS1043ARDB
	- LS1046ARDB
	- LS1021ATSN
	- LS1021AIOT
	- i.MX6Q-SABRESD
	- LS1028ARDB
	- LX2160ARDB
